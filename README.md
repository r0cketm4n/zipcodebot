# zipcodebot

Organized as a function for each store, where a store is the name with all punctuation striped.

You'll need tqdm, requests, unidecode and Python 2.7.15

Running the script is fairly simple, 

zipcodebot.py list | lists all stores not in the finder, with a count of stores in
zipcodebot.py create | creates the places_json.txt, production ready
zipcodebot.py #store# | test run on a certain store
